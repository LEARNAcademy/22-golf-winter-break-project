# Golf Cohort Winter Project

In order to keep up our skills over the Winter Break (and to prevent coding whiplash on January 3), we will be working on our Portfolios and getting them ready for the job hunt.   
The goal of this project is to:
- prepare our Portfolio, 
- get in depth meaningful feedback,
- and hold each other accountable. 

On January 3rd when we come back from break we will be re-presenting our updated portfolios to one another. 

Every student will be a member of a group of 3 or 4. 

To accomplish this project everyone will work on their portfolio and receive feedback from their peers.
Each member of each team is responsible for checking out their team members portfolios, 
making sure they have everything required, and giving helpful constructive feedback. Each team member will be filling out their own version of the document below. Copy the document and add your name to it (ie winter-project-austin.md)


## Your job is to give feedback on parts of your team members portfolios that you think could be imporved. Feedback should be helpful and kind. 

### Title  
  - This should bring people into your site and let them know exactly what you are presenting to them. 
### Elevator pitch
  - A short summary, usually taking 30 secs to explain who you are and what you are looking to accomplish. 
### Links
  -  Should be active and preferably open the link in a new tab
### 3 Projects Displayed
  - Projects are probably the most important part of the portfolio. In the README.md of each project, explain what technologies went into your project, problems you encountered and solutions you came up with. On your portfolio you should have a taste of your project's description and a link to THE LIVE PROJECT, or a video of the project in operation.
